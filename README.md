## Basic understanding

1. What is a distribution in statistics?

- A data distribution is a function or a listing which shows all the possible values (or intervals) of the data. It also (and this is important) tells you how often each value occurs.Often, the data in a distribution will be ordered from smallest to largest, and graphs and charts allow you to easily see both the values and the frequency with which they appear.

2. Parametric modelling
