## Basic understanding

1. What is a distribution in statistics?

- A data distribution is a function or a listing which shows all the possible values (or intervals) of the data. It also (and this is important) 
tells you how often each value occurs

- In probability theory and statistics, a probability distribution is a mathematical function that provides the probabilities of 
occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment. In more technical terms, the probability distribution is a 
description of a random phenomenon in terms of the probabilities of events. For instance, if the random variable X is used 
to denote the outcome of a coin toss ("the experiment"), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for 
X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails (assuming the coin is fair).
